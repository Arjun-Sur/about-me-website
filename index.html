      <h3>Myself</h3>
      <p><img src="images/san-diego.png" id="picture-1" title="San Diego Skyline" />My name is Arjun, and I entered this
        world in November of 2006
        in <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov" target="_blank">San Diego, California</a>, alongside my identical twin
        brother. My background is a blend of Polish and Indian heritage, courtesy of my mother and my father,
        respectively. Currently, I’m in my junior year at Canyon Crest Academy, having previously attended Carmel
        Valley
        Middle School and Sage Canyon Elementary School. As I progress through my academic journey, I’m eagerly
        anticipating graduating and going to college. After graduating with a master’s degree in <span
          class="highlight">Computer Science</span>
        (ideally), I’d like to explore a career in the realm of software engineering.</p>

      <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
      <p><img src="images/wind-ensemble.png" id="picture-2" title="CCA Wind Ensemble" />In my spare time, you’ll often
        find me engrossed in
        programming web apps,
        tweaking video games, and collaborating on various projects with fellow developers. Additionally, I like
        to
        practice <span class="highlight">Trumpet</span> as I play for the <a
          href="https://sites.google.com/sduhsd.net/avillanova/ensembles" target="_blank">CCA Wind Ensemble</a>. Besides
        those activities, I enjoy cooking meals and teaching
        people
        about subjects I am passionate about. I’m always receptive to new ideas and constantly learning more about
        the
        world. Continual learning is a cornerstone of my life, whether it be diving into philosophy or finding
        opportunities for personal growth.</p>

      <h3>My People</h3>
      <p><img src="images/ravens.png" id="picture-3" title="CCA Ravens" />My social circle may be modest in size, but
        it’s comprised
        trusted friends
        whom
        I’ve known for years. Beyond my inner circle, I’m generally friendly with a lot of <a
          href="https://cc.sduhsd.net" target="_blank">my classmates and fellow “ravens.”</a> Of course, <span
          class="highlight">my family</span>
        holds
        significant importance in my life and I cherish the time I spent with my mom, dad, older sister, and twin
        brother. I thrive on authentic connections, often infusing humor and irony into interactions to make them
        more
        enjoyable and memorable. By surrounding myself with genuine individuals who can inspire and educate me is
        how
        I
        truly grow as a person.</p>
